# Python-APIs

Used OpenWeatherMap API to visualize the weather of 500+ cities around the world of varying distance from the equator. Matplot library is used to plot the graphs.
Randomly selected 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
Performed weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
A print log of each city is created as it's being processed with the city number and city name.

A series of scatter plots are built to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
